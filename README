NAME
    feature::each_on_array - Emulate each(@array) on Perl < 5.12

VERSION
    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
     # This can run on Perls older than 5.12 and have no effect on 5.12+
     use feature::each_on_array;

     my @a = (qw/a b c/);
     while (my ($idx, $item) = each @a) {
         ...
     }

DESCRIPTION
    Beginning with 5.12, Perl supports each() on array. This module emulates
    the support on older Perls.

CAVEATS
    Works on a per-package level, but does not work lexically yet.

CREDITS
    Thanks to Toby Inkster for writing the tie handler.
